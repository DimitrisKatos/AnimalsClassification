# 2. Modeling with PyTorch.
The second step of the project contains using PyTorch to create our first model in the `modeling.py`.
In this notebook, we go through all the necessary processes to create a model using PyTorch.
After creating the first model we functionize the processes, so we can use them in the following steps of the project.
The goal of the project is to track some experiments through many different hyperparameters and datasets.

The folder contains the following files.

* `modeling.ipynb` : In this file we create our fist model by using Transfer Learning. 
* `data_setup.py` : Creates DataLoaders
* `engine.py` : Contains the training step
* `model_builder.py`: Create the model
* `utils.py`: Useful functionalities
* `config.py`: stored hyperparameters useful for the problem.
* `prediction.py`: Contains fucntionallities for evaluating the model.
